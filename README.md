Exercise 2

We have a file which has 10 million numbers put in randomly ranging from 0 to 99.
Sort the array and write it to another file without keeping the whole array into memory or reading the whole file at once and putting it in memory.

Exercise 3

There is an attached log file from one of the development web server. 

Line number 2 of this log file is something like this "Processing by SprintsController#show as JSONAPI"

This tells us, sprints controller's show action(method or function) ran. You have to parse this log file and output it the number of times the controller's actions run.

Expected Output:

SprintsController => show action ran 23 times
SprintsController => index action ran 17 times
and so on.

run -> npm run ex3
